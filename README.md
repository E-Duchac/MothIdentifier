This is a project designed to, on being given several common descriptors, return a list of moths which fit the descriptors.

The project uses IBM Operational Decision Manager, a MongoDB database, and a Java Springboot framework.

Currently, there is not a database file saved in the project (this is a work in progress); one will need to build a MongoDB database from scratch in the project's current state.
